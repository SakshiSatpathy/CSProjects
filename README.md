Computer Science Projects' Description

This Github has private code for projects from Gunn High School's Functional Object-Oriented Programming and AP Computer Science classes, and homework, labs and projects from UC Berkeley's CS61B: Data Structures class. For viewing this code, please send me requests to the specific private repositories so that I know you are not a student in the class. 

With respect to projects:

CS61B: Data Structures
Project 0: Signpost
In this project, we created the puzzle game Signpost, which is one of Simon Tatham's collection of GUI games. He attributes the puzzle to Angela and Otto Janko, who call it Pfeilpfad (arrow path). In this mini-project, we were given an incomplete Java program that creates these puzzles and allows its user to solve them, and I must supply the missing parts to complete the implementation. Based on a Model-View-Controller structure, I created a board in the Model class with all variables required to capture its state at any given time, used the Place class to access and modify the position of players, wrote methods to randomly generate new games in the Puzzle Generator class, and modified the Board Widget class to display the puzzle board.
