Computer Science Projects' Description

This Github has private code from homework, labs and projects from the following classes:

UC Berkeley:
1) CompSci C100 (Principles and Techniques of Data Science)

a) Email Spam Filter: Built a filter after training data (reading, cleaning, feature engineering, modelling, fitting, split+testing) on logistic classifier. Bettered the model after extensive feature engineering through correlation plotting and visualization to eliminate multicollinearity, also using cross-validation and regularization during the multiple rounds of training to minimize bias and variance on unseen data. Achieved 99% training accuracy and 98% test accuracy.

b) Food Safety: Investigated San Francisco restaurant food safety scores using SQL and Pandas to clean and visualize data for valid zipcodes, examining lowest and highest scoresâ€™s violations over time, and progress in ratings over multiple inspections. Personally designed experiment to explore  potential causes of missing scores usually removed: found Complaints, New Ownership, and Reinspection/Followup to be leading correlators. 


2) CompSci 61B (Data Structures)


3) CompSci 61A (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs)
